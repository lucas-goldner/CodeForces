# CodeForces Grind

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I am embarking on a thrilling journey to push the limits of my coding abilities on the competitive platform of https://codeforces.com/. I am eager to take on the challenge of mastering the C++ programming language and delving into the world of low-level programming. Join me as I strive to improve my skills, tackle difficult problems, and compete against some of the best programmers in the world. This is not just a simple journey, this is an adventure, and I'm inviting you to join me, let's conquer the coding world together.

Ok, tbh I just want to try to become better at programming and I think I can achieve that, by solving complex problems,
so that is why I will start grinding the problemsets. Haven't used C++ yet so lets see how that goes.
